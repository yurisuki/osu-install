# introduction
Install osu! on Linux by executing one script and pressing ENTER! It just takes shy of ~8 minutes on my machine (Could take less on yours) to have fully functioning osu!.

Yes, exactly, that's what this script does do! No more need to hassle with the difficult and time-consuming installation.
